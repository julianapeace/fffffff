## fffffigure how much you fffffucked up


Do you ever wonder how many lambos you would have right now?

I do!

Sometimes I lie awake at night and go "ffffffffuuuuuu"

But I'll never wonder again.

So to drown those voices, use this handy dandy command line tool!


## How to get started:
  1. First, make a file for environment variables. Duplicate `.example.env` into a file named `.env`.
  2. Get an api key from [CoinApi](https://www.coinapi.io/). Then, set the value to `coinapi_api_key` the .env file.
  3. Run `pipenv install` to install all pip dependencies from the Pipfile
  4. Run `python3 run.py` to start the command-line tool
  5. ....
  6. lambo (or no lambo)


## How to use fffff:
  ffffff takes four arguments
  `token` = token symbol (e.g. BTC, ETH, HNT, CRV)
  `wen_buy` = wen buy ser. Takes in the format YYYY-MM-DD (e.g. 2019-12-04)
  `wen_sell`= wen sell ser. If no value is entered, the default is today. Takes in the format YYYY-MM-DD (e.g. 2019-12-04)
  `how_much_money` = how rich ser. Integer only. In U.S. dollars only. (e.g. 9000)
